<h1><em><strong>Light-bearer</strong></em></h1>
<p>It's funny how the sun <br>
seems to hate the moon <br>
<br>
As it turns its face <br>
against the orange lagoon <br>
<br>
But fear not, for the sun <br>
never really hated her <br>
<br>
As long as he exists, <br>
the moon knows him as the light-bearer <br>
<br>
